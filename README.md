# Face Classification with VGG16 ðŸ‘€

This project uses a VGG16 model for binary face classification. The dataset is preprocessed using MediaPipe for face detection before being fed into the model.

Create test, train and validation folders in the root, where train and validation has "classX" folders with images inside.
